.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
hist [flags] [first [last]]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBhist\fP lists, edits, or re\-executes, commands previously entered into
the current shell environment.
.sp
The command history list references commands by number. The first number
in the list is selected arbitrarily.  The relationship of a number to its
command does not change during a login session.  When the number reaches
32767 the number wraps around to 1 but maintains the ordering.
.sp
When commands are edited (when the \fB\-l\fP option is not specified), the
resulting lines will be entered at the end of the history list and then
re\-executed by the current shell.  The \fB\ef?\ef\fP command that caused the
editing will not be entered into the history list.  If the editor returns
a non\-zero exit status, this will suppress the entry into the history
list and the command re\-execution.  Command line variable assignments
and redirections affect both the f?f command and the commands that
are re\-executed.
.sp
\fIfirst\fP and \fIlast\fP define the range of commands. \fIfirst\fP and \fIlast\fP
can be one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fInumber\fP
A positive number representing a command number.  A \fB+\fP
sign can precede \fInumber\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-\fInumber\fP
A negative number representing a command that was
executed \fInumber\fP commands previously. For example, \fB\-1\fP is the
previous command. This is equivalent to \fB\-N\fP\fInumber\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fIstring\fP
\fIstring\fP indicates the most recently entered command
that begins with \fIstring\fP\&. \fIstring\fP should not contain an \fB=\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fIfirst\fP is omitted, the previous command is used, unless \fB\-l\fP is
specified, in which case it will default to \fB\-16\fP and \fIlast\fP will
default to \fB\-1\fP\&.
.sp
If \fIfirst\fP is specified and \fIlast\fP is omitted, then \fIlast\fP will
default to \fIfirst\fP unless \fB\-l\fP is specified in which case it will
default to \fB\-1\fP\&.
.sp
If no editor is specified, then the editor specified by the \fBHISTEDIT\fP
variable will be used if set, or the \fBFCEDIT\fP variable will be used if
set, otherwise, \fBed\fP will be used.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-e \fIeditor\fP
\fIeditor\fP specifies the editor to use to edit the history
command.  A value of \fB\-\fP for \fIeditor\fP is equivalent to specifying the
\fB\-s\fP option.
.TP
.B \-l
List the commands rather than editing and re\-executing them.
.TP
.B \-n
Suppress the command numbers when the commands are listed.
.TP
.B \-p
Writes the result of history expansion for each operand to standard
output.  All other options are ignored.
.TP
.B \-r
Reverse the order of the commands.
.TP
.B \-s
Re\-execute the command without invoking an editor.  In this case an
operand of the form \fIold*\(ga=\(ga*new\fP can be specified to change the
first occurrence of the string \fIold\fP in the command to \fInew\fP before
re\-executing the command.
.TP
.B \-N \fInum\fP
Start at \fInum\fP commands back.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
If a command is re\-executed, the exit status is that of the command that
gets re\-executed.  Otherwise, it is one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B 0
Successfully completion of the listing.
.TP
.B >0
An error occurred.
.UNINDENT
