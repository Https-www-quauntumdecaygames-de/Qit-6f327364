.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
With the first form in which \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-L\fP is not specified, \fBkill\fP sends
a signal to one or more processes specified by \fIjob\fP\&.  This normally
terminates the processes unless the signal is being caught or ignored.
.sp
Each \fIjob\fP can be specified as one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIint\fP
Refers to a process id (pid).
.TP
.B \-\fIint\fP
Refers to a process group id (pgrp).
.TP
.B \fB%\fP\fIint\fP
Refers to a job number.
.TP
.B \fB%\fP\fIstr\fP
Refers to a job whose name begins with \fIstr\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB%?\fP\fIstr\fP
Refers to a job whose name contains \fIstr\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB%%\fP
Refers to the current job.
.TP
.B \fB%+\fP
Refers to the current job.
.TP
.B \fB%\-\fP
Refers to the previous job.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the signal is not specified with either the \fB\-n\fP or the \fB\-s\fP option,
the \fBSIGTERM\fP signal is used.
.sp
If \fB\-l\fP is specified, and no \fIarg\fP is specified, then \fBkill\fP writes the
list of signals to standard output.  Otherwise, \fIarg\fP can be either a
signal name, or a number representing either a signal number or exit
status for a process that was terminated due to a signal.  If a name is
given the corresponding signal number will be written to standard output.
If a number is given the corresponding signal name will be written to
standard output.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l
List signal names or signal numbers rather than sending signals as
described above.  The \fB\-n\fP and \fB\-s\fP options cannot be specified.
.TP
.B \-q \fIn\fP
On systems that support \fIsigqueue\fP(2), send a queued signal with
message number than can only be as large as a signed integer.  The \fIjob\fP
must be specified as a positive number. On systems that do not support
\fIsigqueue\fP(2), a signal is sent without the message number \fIn\fP and
the signal will not be queued.
.TP
.B \-L
Same as \fB\-l\fP except that if no argument is specified the signals
will be listed in menu format as with select compound command.
.TP
.B \-n \fIsignum\fP
Specify a signal number to send.  Signal numbers are not
portable across platforms, except for the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
0  No signal
1  \fBHUP\fP
2  \fBINT\fP
3  \fBQUIT\fP
6  \fBABRT\fP
9  \fBKILL\fP
14 \fBALRM\fP
15 \fBTERM\fP
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \-s \fIsigname\fP
Specify a signal name to send.  The signal names are
derived from their names in C header \fB<signal.h>\fP without the \fBSIG\fP
prefix and are case insensitive.  \fBkill \-l\fP will emit the list of
signals on the current platform.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B 0
At least one matching process was found for each \fIjob\fP operand, and the
specified signal was successfully sent to at least one matching process.
.TP
.B >0
An error occurred.  A value of \fB2\fP is returned when \fB\-q\fP is used and
it fails with the error EAGAIN.
