.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
readonly [flags] [name[=value]...]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBreadonly\fP sets the readonly attribute on each of the variables specified
by \fIname\fP which prevents their values from being changed.  If \fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP
is specified, the variable \fIname\fP is set to \fIvalue\fP before the variable
is made readonly.
.sp
Within a type definition, if the value is not specified, then a value
must be specified when creating each instance of the type and the value
is readonly for each instance.
.sp
If no \fIname\fPs are specified then the names and values of all readonly
variables are written to standard output.
.sp
\fBreadonly\fP is built\-in to the shell as a declaration command so that
field splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the arguments.
Tilde expansion occurs on \fIvalue\fP\&.
.SH FLAGS
