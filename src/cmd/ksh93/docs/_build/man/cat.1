.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
cat [flags] [file ...]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcat\fP copies each \fIfile\fP in sequence to the standard output. If no \fIfile\fP
is given, or if the \fIfile\fP is \fB\-\fP, \fBcat\fP copies from standard input
starting at the current location.
.sp
\fBThis command is not enabled by default.\fP To enable it run \fBbuiltin cat\fP\&.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-number\-nonblank
Number lines as with \fB\-n\fP but omit line numbers
from blank lines.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-dos\-input
Input files are opened in \fItext\fP mode which removes
carriage returns in front of new\-lines on some systems.
.TP
.B \-e
Equivalent to \fB\-vE\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-number
Causes a line number to be inserted at the beginning of
each line.
.TP
.B \-s
Equivalent to \fB\-S\fP for \fIatt\fP universe and \fB\-B\fP otherwise.
.TP
.B \-t
Equivalent to \fB\-vT\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-u, \-\-unbuffer
The output is not delayed by buffering.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-show\-nonprinting, \-\-print\-chars
Print characters as follows:
space and printable characters as themselves; control characters as
\fB^\fP followed by a letter of the alphabet; and characters with the
high bit set as the lower 7 bit character prefixed by \fBM^\fP for 7 bit
non\-printable characters and \fBM\-\fP for all other characters. If the 7
bit character encoding is not ASCII then the characters are converted
to ASCII to determine \fIhigh bit set\fP, and if set it is cleared and
converted back to the native encoding. Multibyte characters in the
current locale are treated as printable characters.
.TP
.B \-A, \-\-show\-all
Equivalent to \fB\-vET\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-B, \-\-squeeze\-blank
Multiple adjacent new\-line characters are replace
by one new\-line.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-dos\-output
Output files are opened in \fItext\fP mode which inserts
carriage returns in front of new\-lines on some systems.
.TP
.B \-E, \-\-show\-ends
Causes a \fB$\fP to be inserted before each new\-line.
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-silent
\fBcat\fP is silent about non\-existent files.
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-show\-blank
Causes tabs to be copied as \fB^I\fP and formfeeds as \fB^L\fP\&.
