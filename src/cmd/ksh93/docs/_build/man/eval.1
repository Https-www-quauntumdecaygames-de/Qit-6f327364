.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
eval [arg ...]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBeval\fP is a shell special built\-in command that constructs a command
by concatenating the \fIarg*s together, separating each with a space.
The resulting string is then taken as input to the shell and evaluated
in the current environment.  Note that command words are expanded twice;
once to construct *arg\fP, and again when the shell executes the constructed
command.
.sp
It is not an error if \fIarg\fP is not given.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
If \fIarg\fP is not specified, the exit status is \fB0\fP\&.  Otherwise, it is the
exit status of the command defined by the \fIarg\fP operands.
.SH SEE ALSO
.sp
\fBexec\fP(1), \fBtrap\fP(1), \fB\&.\fP(1)
