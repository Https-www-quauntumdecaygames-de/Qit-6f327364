.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
cut [flags] [file ...]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcut\fP bytes, characters, or character\-delimited fields from one or more
files, contatenating them on standard output.
.sp
The option argument \fIlist\fP is a comma\-separated or blank\-separated list
of positive numbers and ranges.  Ranges can be of three forms.  The first
is two positive integers separated by a hyphen (\fIlow*\(ga\-\(ga*high\fP), which
represents all fields from \fIlow\fP to \fIhigh\fP\&.  The second is a positive
number preceded by a hyphen (\fB\-\fP\fIhigh\fP), which represents all fields
from field \fB1\fP to \fIhigh\fP\&.  The last is a positive number followed by a
hyphen (\fIlow*\(ga\-\(ga), which represents all fields from *low\fP to the last
field, inclusive.  Elements in the \fIlist\fP can be repeated, can overlap,
and can appear in any order.  The order of the output is that of the input.
.sp
One and only one of \fB\-b\fP, \fB\-c\fP, or \fB\-f\fP must be specified.
.sp
If no \fIfile\fP is given, or if the \fIfile\fP is \fB\-\fP, \fBcut\fP cuts from
standard input.  The start of the file is defined as the current offset.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-bytes=*list*
\fBcut\fP based on a list of byte counts.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-characters=*list*
\fBcut\fP based on a list of character counts.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-delimiter=*delim*
The field character for the \fB\-f\fP
option is set to \fIdelim\fP\&.  The default is the \fBtab\fP character.
.TP
.B \-f, fields=*list*
\fBcut\fP based on fields separated by the
delimiter character specified with the \fB\-d\fP optiion.
.TP
.B \-\-split
Split multibyte characters selected by the \fB\-b\fP option. This is the default.
.TP
.B \-n
Do not split multibyte characters selected by the \fB\-b\fP option.
.TP
.B \-R, \-r, \-\-reclen=*reclen*
If \fIreclen\fP > 0, the
input will be read as fixed length records of length \fIreclen\fP when
used with the \fB\-b\fP or \fB\-c\fP option.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-suppress, \-\-only\-delimited
Suppress lines with no delimiter
characters, when used with the \fB\-f\fP option.  By default, lines with
no delimiters will be passsed in untouched.
.TP
.B \-D, \-\-line\-delimiter, \-\-output\-delimiter=*ldelim*
The line delimiter character for the \fB\-f\fP option is set to \fIldelim\fP\&.
The default is the \fBnewline\fP character. Note that \fB\-\-line\-delimeter\fP
is also recognized for compatibility with ksh93u+ and earlier versions.
.TP
.B \-N
Do not output new\-lines at end of each record when used with the
\fB\-b\fP or \fB\-c\fP option.
.TP
.B \-\-newline
Output new\-lines at end of each record when used with the
\fB\-b\fP or \fB\-c\fP option. On by default.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B 0
All files processed successfully.
.TP
