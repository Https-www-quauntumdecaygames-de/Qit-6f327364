.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
builtin [flags] [pathname ...]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBbuiltin\fP can be used to add, delete, or display built\-in commands in the
current shell environment. A built\-in command executes in the current
shell process and can have side effects in the current shell. On most
systems, the invocation time for built\-in commands is one or two orders
of magnitude less than commands that create a separate process.
.sp
For each \fIpathname\fP specified, the basename of the pathname determines
the name of the built\-in. For each basename, the shell looks for a C level
function in the current shell whose name is determined by prepending \fBb_\fP
to the built\-in name. If \fIpathname\fP contains a \fB/\fP, then the built\-in
is bound to this pathname. A built\-in bound to a pathname will only be
executed if \fIpathname\fP is the first executable found during a path
search. Otherwise, built\-ins are found prior to performing the path search.
.sp
If no \fIpathname\fP operands are specified, then \fBbuiltin\fP displays the
current list of built\-ins, or just the special built\-ins if \fB\-s\fP is
specified, on standard output. The full pathname for built\-ins that are
bound to pathnames are displayed.
.sp
Libraries containing built\-ins can be specified with the \fB\-f\fP option. If
the library contains a function named \fBlib_init\fP(), this function will
be invoked with argument \fB0\fP when the library is loaded. The \fBlib_init\fP()
function can load built\-ins by invoking an appropriate C level function. In
this case there is no restriction on the C level function name.
.sp
The C level function will be invoked with three arguments. The first
two are the same as \fBmain\fP() and the third one is a pointer.
.sp
\fBbuiltin\fP cannot be invoked from a restricted shell.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-d
Deletes each of the specified built\-ins. Special built\-ins cannot be deleted.
.TP
.B \-f \fIlib\fP
On systems with dynamic linking, \fIlib\fP names a shared
library to load and search for built\-ins. Libraries are searched
for in \fB\&../lib/ksh\fP and \fB\&../lib\fP on \fB$PATH\fP and in system dependent
library directories. The system dependent shared library prefix
and/or suffix may be omitted. Once a library is loaded, its symbols
become available for the current and subsequent invocations of
\fBbuiltin\fP\&. Multiple libraries can be specified with separate invocations
of \fBbuiltin\fP\&. Libraries are searched in the reverse order in which
they are specified.
.TP
.B \-l
List the library base name, plugin YYYYMMDD version stamp, and full
path for \fB\-f\fP\fIlib\fP on one line on the standard output.
.TP
.B \-n
Disable each of the specified built\-ins. Special built\-ins cannot be
disabled.  If no built\-ns are specified, display all disabled built\-ins.
.TP
.B \-p
Causes the output to be in a form of \fBbuiltin\fP commands that can be
used as input to the shell to recreate the current set of builtins.
.TP
.B \-s
Display only the special built\-ins.
