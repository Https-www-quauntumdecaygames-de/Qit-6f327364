.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
sleep [flags] [duration]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBsleep\fP suspends execution for at least the time specified by \fIduration\fP
or until a \fBSIGALRM\fP signal is received. The \fIduration\fP is a floating
point literal for the number of seconds to sleep. The actual granularity
depends on the underlying system, normally around 1 millisecond. This
can be followed by \fBs\fP for seconds, \fBm\fP for minutes, \fBh\fP for hours, or
\fBd\fP for days.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s
Sleep until a signal or a timeout is received. If \fIduration\fP is
omitted or less than or equal to zero then no timeout will be used.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B 0
The execution was successfully suspended for at least \fIduration\fP or a
\fBSIGALRM\fP signal was received.
.TP
.B >0
An error occurred.
