Each \fIjob\fP can be specified as one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIint\fP
Refers to a process id (pid).
.TP
.B \fB%\fP\fIint\fP
Refers to a job number.
.TP
.B \fB%\fP\fIstr\fP
Refers to a job whose name begins with \fIstr\fP\&.

known by the current shell environment, \fBwait\fP treats each of them as if
it were a process that exited with status 127.
.SH EXIT STATUS

If \fIwait\fP is invoked with one or more \fIjob\fPs, and all of them have
terminated or were not known by the invoking shell, the exit status of
\fBwait\fP will be that of the last \fIjob\fP\&.  Otherwise, it will be one of
the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B 0
\fBwait\fP utility was invoked with no operands and all processes known
by the invoking process have terminated.
