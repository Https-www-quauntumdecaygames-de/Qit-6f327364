.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
export [flags] [name[=value]...]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBexport\fP sets the export attribute on each of the variables specified
by \fIname\fP which causes them to be in the environment of subsequently
executed commands.  If \fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP is specified, the variable \fIname\fP
is set to \fIvalue\fP\&.
.sp
If no \fIname\fPs are specified then the names and values of all exported
variables are written to standard output.
.sp
\fBexport\fP is built\-in to the shell as a declaration command so that field
splitting and pathname expansion are not performed on the arguments.
Tilde expansion occurs on \fIvalue\fP\&.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
