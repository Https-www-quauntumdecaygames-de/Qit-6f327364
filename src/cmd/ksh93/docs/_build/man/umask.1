.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
umask [flags] [mask]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBumask\fP sets the file creation mask of the current shell execution
environment to the value specified by the \fImask\fP operand.  This mask
affects the file permission bits of subsequently created files.  \fImask\fP can
either be an octal number or a symbolic value as described in \fBchmod\fP(1).
If a symbolic value is given, the new file creation mask is the complement
of the result of applying \fImask\fP to the complement of the current file
creation mask.
.sp
If \fImask\fP is not specified, \fBumask\fP writes the value of the file creation
mask for the current process to standard output.
.SH FLAGS

.B \-S
