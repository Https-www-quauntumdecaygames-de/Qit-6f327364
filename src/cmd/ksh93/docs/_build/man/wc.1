.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
wc [flags] [file...]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBwc\fP reads one or more input files and, by default, for each file
writes a line containing the number of newlines, \fIword\fPs, and bytes
contained in each file followed by the file name to standard output in
that order.  A \fIword\fP is defined to be a non\-zero length string delimited
by \fBisspace\fP(3) characters.
.sp
If more than one file is specified, \fBwc\fP writes a total count for all of
the named files with \fBtotal\fP written instead of the file name.
.sp
By default, \fBwc\fP writes all three counts.  Options can specified so that
only certain counts are written.  The options \fB\-c\fP and \fB\-m\fP are mutually
exclusive.
.sp
If no \fIfile\fP is given, or if the \fIfile\fP is \fB\-\fP, \fBwc\fP reads from standard
input and no filename is written to standard output.  The start of the
file is defined as the current offset.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-lines
List the line counts.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-words
List the word counts.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-bytes, \-\-chars
List the byte counts.
.TP
.B \-m, \-C, \-\-multibyte\-chars
List the character counts.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Suppress invalid multibyte character warnings.
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-longest\-line, \-\-max\-line\-length
List the longest line length;
the newline, if any, is not counted in the length.
.TP
.B \-N, \-\-noutf8
For UTF\-8 locales \fB\-\-noutf8\fP disables UTF\-8 optimzations
and relies on the native \fBmbtowc\fP(3).
.TP
.B \-\-utf8
For UTF\-8 locales \fB\-\-utf8\fP enables UTF\-8 optimzations
and relies on the native \fBmbtowc\fP(3). This is the default.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B 0
All files processed successfully.
.TP
