.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
cmp [flags] file1 file2 [skip1 [skip2]]
.fi
.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcmp\fP compares two files \fIfile1\fP and \fIfile2\fP\&. \fBcmp\fP writes
no output if the files are the same. By default, if the
files differ, the byte and line number at which the first
difference occurred are written to standard output. Bytes
and lines are numbered beginning with 1.
.sp
If \fIskip1\fP or \fIskip2\fP are specified, or the \fB\-i\fP option
is specified, initial bytes of the corresponding file are
skipped before beginning the compare. The skip values are
in bytes or can have a suffix of \fBk\fP for kilobytes or \fBm\fP
for megabytes.
.sp
If either \fIfile1\fP or \fIfiles2\fP is \fB\-\fP, \fBcmp\fP uses standard
input starting at the current location.
.sp
\fBThis command is not enabled by default.\fP To enable it run \fBbuiltin chmod\fP\&.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-print\-bytes
Print differing bytes as 3 digit octal values.
.TP
.B \-c, \-\-print\-chars
Print differing bytes as follows: non\-space printable
characters as themselves; space and control characters as \fB^\fP followed
by a letter of the alphabet; and characters with the high bit set
as the lower 7 bit character prefixed by \fBM^\fP for 7 bit space and
non\-printable characters and \fBM\-\fP for all other characters. If the 7
bit character encoding is not ASCII then the characters are converted
to ASCII to determine \fIhigh bit set\fP, and if set it is cleared and
converted back to the native encoding. Multibyte characters in the
current locale are treated as printable characters.
.TP
.B \-d \fIn\fP, \-\-differences=*n*
Print at most \fIdifferences\fP differences using
\fB\-\-verbose\fP output format. \fB\-\-differences=0\fP is equivalent to
\fB\-\-silent\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-i \fIskip1\fP:\fIskip2\fP, \-\-ignore\-initial=*skip1*:\fIskip2\fP, \-\-skip=*skip1*:\fIskip2\fP
Skip the the first \fIskip1\fP bytes in \fIfile1\fP and the first \fIskip2\fP
bytes in \fIfile2\fP\&. If \fIskip2\fP is omitted then \fIskip1\fP is used.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-verbose
Write the decimal byte number and the differing bytes
(in octal) for each difference.
.TP
.B \-n \fIn\fP, \-\-count=*n*, \-\-bytes=*n*
Compare at most \fIn\fP bytes.
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-quiet, \-\-silent
Write nothing for differing files; return non\-zero
exit status only.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B 0
The files or portions compared are identical.
.TP
.B 1
The files are different.
.TP
.B >1
An error occurred.
