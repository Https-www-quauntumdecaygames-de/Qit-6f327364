.SH SYNOPSIS

.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBcd\fP changes the current working directory of the current shell environment.
.sp
In the first form with one operand, if \fIdirectory\fP begins with \fB/\fP, or if
the first component is \fB\&.\fP or \fB\&..\fP, the directory will be changed to this
directory.  If directory is \fB\-\fP, the directory will be changed to the last
directory visited.  Otherwise, if the \fBCDPATH\fP environment variable is set,
\fBcd\fP searches for \fIdirectory\fP relative to each directory named in the colon
separated list of directories defined by \fBCDPATH\fP\&.  If \fBCDPATH\fP not set,
\fBcd\fP changes to the directory specified by \fIdirectory\fP\&.
.sp
In the second form, the first occurrence of the string \fIold\fP contained in
the pathname of the present working directory is replaced by the string
\fInew\fP and the resulting string is used as the directory to which to change.
.sp
When invoked without operands and when the \fBHOME\fP environment variable
is set to a nonempty value, the directory named by the \fBHOME\fP environment
variable will be used.  If \fBHOME\fP is empty or unset, it will use the home
directory for the effective user if possible.  Otherwise \fBcd\fP will fail.
.sp
When \fBcd\fP is successful, the \fBPWD\fP environment variable will be set to the
name of an absolute pathname that does not contain any \fB\&..\fP components
corresponding to the new directory.  The environment variable \fBOLDPWD\fP
will be set to the previous value of \fBPWD\fP\&.  If the new directory is
found by searching the directories named by \fBCDPATH\fP, or if \fIdirectory\fP
is \fB\-\fP, or if the two operand form is used, the new value of \fBPWD\fP will
be written to standard output.
.sp
If both \fB\-L\fP and \fB\-P\fP are specified, the last one specified will be used.
If neither \fB\-P\fP or \fB\-L\fP is specified the default behavior is as if \fB\-L\fP
was specified.
.SH FLAGS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f \fIdirfd\fP
The directory path is relative to the open file descriptor \fIdirfd\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-L
Handle each pathname component \fB\&..\fP in a logical fashion by moving
up one level by name in the present working directory.
.TP
.B \-P
The present working directory is first converted to an absolute
pathname that does not contain symbolic link components and symbolic
name components are expanded in the resulting directory name.
.TP
.B \-@
Change into the hidden attribute directory of \fIdirectory\fP which may
also be a file. \fBCDPATH\fP is ignored. Hidden attribute directories are
file system and operating system specific.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B 0
Directory successfully changed.
.TP
.B >0
An error occurred.
